 You can call the following tools to get more information about the code.
 Prefer higher-priority tools first; only use view_code when you already know the exact file path and a line number:
 
 1) get_symbol_header_tool — Get the header file(s) needed for a symbol. Try an absolute path first (e.g., #include "/path/to/header.h"). If that fails with ".h file not found", try a project-relative path.
 2) get_symbol_definition_tool — Get the definition of a symbol (the function body or struct/class definition).
 3) get_symbol_declaration_tool — Get the declaration (prototype/signature) of a symbol.
 4) get_symbol_references_tool — Get the references/usage of a symbol within the codebase.
 5) get_struct_related_functions_tool — Get helper functions that operate on a struct/class (e.g., init, destroy, setters/getters).
 6) view_code — View code around a specific file path and target line. Use this only when the path and line are known; keep context_window small.
 7) get_file_location_tool - Get the absolute path of a file in the project codebase.
 8) get_driver_example_tool - Randomly select one harness file in the container and return its content. 

 Guardrails:
 - Don't call view_code repeatedly to browse; instead, first retrieve definitions/headers/references to precisely locate what you need.
 - Avoid requesting huge windows; stay within a small context_window unless specifically needed.
